England hath long been mad and scarred herself
the brother blindly shed the brother’s blood
the father rashly slaughtered his own son
the son compelled been butcher to the sire
all this divided York and Lancaster
divided in their dire division
now let Richmond and Elizabeth
the true succeeders of each royal house
by God’s fair ordinance conjoin together
and let their heirs God if thy will be so
enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace
with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
